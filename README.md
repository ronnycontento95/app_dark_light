## To get started: in the pubspec.yaml directory
flutter pug get
flutter upgrade
flutter run

## Extensions and the plugin that are installed to have my multilingual application are two different things:

1. The plugin in the same Android Studio:
Flutter International

2. Pub.dev extension:
flutter_locations:
   sdk:flutter
flutter_intl:
   enabled: true


## The application has configured to be responsible:
1. Web, mobile, tablet.
2. Texts, subtitles.
3. Colors.
Note: The app responds to both colors for dark and light.
